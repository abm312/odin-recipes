    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Biryani is a delicious savory rice dish that is loaded with spicy marinated chicken, caramelized onions, and flavorful saffron rice. For my Biryani, I simplify the order of operations, while retaining the traditional layered approach to assembling it. This recipe captures the essence of how I like to make it, with a few of my own touches. Itâ€™s the perfect dish to make for a special occasion or for a casual dinner with friends and family.</p>
